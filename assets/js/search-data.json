For the time being, to set those parameters in your deployment, contact our support. | If desired, have our support configure traffic filters. This prevents unwanted access to your deployment. | Create service accounts for data delivery (when not using Agent and Fleet, cf. below) and generate API keys for them. For more information see: Grant access using API keys. | . Loading Data into Elastic . | Load data into your cluster. We recommend using the Elastic Agent in cooperation with the Fleet Server. You can find detailed instructions here: Ship Data to ECE. | To avoid connection problems to your cluster, make sure to disable sniffing in the Elasticsearch clients used (e.g. fluentd). Elastic Agent, Filebeat etc. automatically behave correctly. | If you want to migrate data from your existing Elastic cluster to your new deployment, you can find some methods in the Elastic documentation: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud-enterprise/current/ece-migrating-data.html. | In Kibana, review your index templates and lifecycle policies so you can assign your data to your desired Hot, Warm, Cold, Frozen (and delete) tiers.

It is the only component to install since it brings all the beats and manages them and their configurations on the client. | . | Fleet Server | A component in your deployment that manages all agents downstream. All settings in Fleet are made in Kibana. | . | Integration | In this context, it is a pre-configured (mostly provided by Elastic) set of agent settings, ingest pipelines and Kibana dashboards for a specific type of log source (e.g. Tomcat, nginx, MySQL, Cisco Equipment, …). Integrations are readily available for most common log sources (see: https://www.elastic.co/integrations/data-integrations) | . | Agent Policy | A collection of agent settings and integrations (in the form of a policy) that tells the agent and the underlying beats what data to collect and from where. You need a separate agent policy for each type of log source. When, for example, all your MySQL Databases store their logs in the same local path (which they should anyway), one agent policy for MySQL databases is sufficient. An agent policy can contain multiple integrations and thus an agent can collect logs from multiple applications on the same log source. You cannot have more than one policy for one agent. Let’s assume that on some hosts you only have Apache httpd installed, while on other hosts you have httpd and Tomcat installed. Then you need (at least) two agent policies: one for httpd and one for httpd+tomcat. | . | Enrollment Token | Is required by the agent when starting on the client node. It serves two purposes: First, it provides the initial authentication of the agent to the Fleet and Elastic servers. Second, it references exactly one agent policy, so that Fleet server can tell the agent which log sources to collect data from. Each agent policy has at least one enrollment token. Enrollment tokens are sensitive data by nature and should therefore be stored securely. | . ",

Then click on your new integration, and you will see that one integration is already pre-configured: the system integration, which collects system logs and metrics from the client machine itself. Linux, Windows or macOS? No need to worry, the agent will figure this out and configure correctly. Depending on the type of log source you want to collect data from, add other integrations, e.g. here for Apache products: . By clicking on the tile, you will not only get an overview of the integration’s features and components. After clicking on Add Integration, you can also customize its settings on the following page.

After the data has been collected in the index for 7 days or the index reaches a size of 50 GB, we want the index to immediately transition to the second phase, called the warm phase. In this tier we lower the priority of the indices and set them to read-only. Cold Phase . After 7 days in the warm phase, data moves to the next phase, called the cold phase.

Upon request, a fourth network can be created: Lab. This is intended for direct connection without the Barracuda Firewall. How are subnet separations managed? . The networks are purely virtualized via OpenVSwitch. Compliance with zones is managed in the OperationsCenter via Security Rules and Security Groups, which are IPFilter rules in OpenStack Neutron. ",

Groups vs Roles: Difference between Roles and Groups . The Operations Center currently has 4 user groups: . | External Users | Users (SSO) | Admins (SSO) | Global Admins (SSO) | . Can admin rights be restricted to one project only? How? . Users automatically have full access to projects they create. Other project owners can pass on the right. How can I change the owner of a project? . Any project owner and admin with access to the project can change the permissions. What happens when a user leaves the company? . Through SSO integration, the user automatically loses access. It may be necessary to reassign their projects. See the previous point. VPN accesses must be deleted manually. Can specifications be made on how a project should be named? . During creation. There is no provision for changes. How is a VPN created? . Global administrators can activate the function for individual projects. Project owners can further enable users added to the project. How are project shares created? . On the home page of each project via the member list. How are flavors managed? . Flavors are managed in OpenStack. Each “public” flavor is available for configuration in Operations Center. If a “public” flavor should no longer be selectable in Operations Center when creating a VM, the metadata of the flavor can be changed accordingly. To do this, select the flavor in Horizon, click on “Update Metadata”, enter visibility in the “Custom” field and add it with “+”. The field now appears under “Existing Metadata”. Enter the value “false” here and save the change. The flavor can now no longer be selected when creating a new VM. Existing VMs that use this flavor are not affected and can still be managed in Operations Center. Flavors cannot be restricted to individual users. Are flavors allowed to be deleted? . Yes, but only if it’s ensured that no VM is using the flavor. Deletion is done via Horizon. If a flavor is deleted that is still in use, each project that has a VM using that flavor cannot be managed in Operations Center any more. Where can logs be viewed if a VM has been created but doesn’t appear? . It’s possible to observe and repeat the VM startup process via Horizon. How can VMs be deleted from other users/projects? . Only users and global administrators with project access can delete VMs. Project list in Operations Center vs Horizon . Projects from the Operations Center are also visible in Horizon. Projects created in Horizon are not visible in the Operations Center. How can VMs be started? . VMs can be started via the “Start” button in the Operations Center. How can the disk size of an existing VM be increased in Operations Center? . It’s not possible. How can external/internal users be deleted? . Internal users are authenticated via SSO. If they are disabled there, they are automatically blocked. External users can be deleted by administrators in the overview of external users in the Operations Center. How can the router be edited and configured? . The Operations Center automatically configures routers according to project specifications. How can routes be edited in the Operations Center? . Additional routes cannot be set up in the Operations Center. How can an SSH key be added to an existing VM? . It’s not possible to add SSH keys via the Operations Center after VM creation. They must be added directly to the VM. Volume Sizes . The Operations Center allows the creation of volumes in different sizes. The list can be expanded upon request. Can the Operations Center be configured via API? . No, that is not intended. How can I log in to a Windows VM? The user ‘operation’ does not work with the entered password. Instead of the ‘operation’ user, for Windows VMs, the user of the selected image must be used. Often Administrator. ",

    "content": "Zones . Security zones are structured in hierarchically descending order, starting with the Private/Internal Zone, followed by the Shared Zone and Public Zone. Based on this, virtual machines (VMs) can communicate hierarchically descending by assigning floating IPs. If VMs are located in the Private/Internal Zones, communication with floating IPs in the Shared and Public Zones is possible. However, the reverse, from the Shared Zone to the Private/Internal Zones, is not allowed. Similarly, communication from the Public Zone to the Shared Zone to the Private/Internal Zones is not allowed. Communication always follows the principle from secure to insecure. This hierarchical structure allows orderly and security-conscious communication between the different zones. Furthermore, floating IPs from the Private/Internal Zones are only reachable from the institute network, services with a floating IP from the Public IP can be provided to the internet through the institute IT. On request, a Lab Zone can be set up as a special zone with a direct connection to the switches. The zones are managed by the Operations Center. For projects created in OpenStack, the user is responsible. How can the hardware servers be shut down/restarted? For example, during a temporary power outage. Currently only through a request in the Jira Helpdesk. Do servers start automatically after a power outage? . The servers start automatically, but the edge is not automatically usable, as CEPH replication is disabled during a controlled shutdown. This must be re-enabled upon restart. If the attached Windows image is selected, does it already include a license? What kind of license is it? . It’s a trial license from Microsoft. For Windows VMs, the customer is responsible for acquiring and adding a license. NVLink and NVSwitches . NVLink and NVSwitches connect NVidia graphics cards for direct data exchange between the graphics cards. Currently, we use Supermicro GPU servers, which do not have NVLink or NVSwitches between the individual GPUs. At present, NVLink and NVSwitches are only installed in NVidia’s own servers of the DGX or HGX brand. ",

In this step, you will use a pre-made heat template and later, will learn how to write one yourself. Everything you created in steps 9 through 11 are easily expressed in a single template. Let’s start with an example template. This template creates a stack that includes a VM, two security groups, a virtual network (including router, port, and subnet), and a floating-IP.

This is the basic structure for your stack, the file can be saved under the name groups.yaml. Create a new template exampleserver.yaml and define the VM here. Make sure that name and network_id are not defined. Use a valid value to fill image:. You can use the image name or ID.

You can now modify your groups.yaml and add a resource group where you add the VMs with the required arguments. After the file has been updated, it can be saved as exampleserver.yaml . The next step is to integrate the second template created as a resource group.

If there is already a bucket available with the name test, you cannot create another one with the name test. We recommend using a UUID and then resolving it in the corresponding application. You can also differentiate between public and private buckets. By default, all buckets are private, and only the creator of the bucket can access them. If needed, you can change it, for example with the Access Control List (ACL). IMPORTANT: If you set a bucket to public, all files in it are reachable. Information about files in this bucket that are set to private can also be retrieved. We recommend only setting specific files to public.

In order to make use of the shared network, there is the option to create a new port. This then receives a random IP address to use, for example, to add a router through this port. This is not possible in the Horizon dashboard; we need to use the OpenStackClient. Please ensure that no spaces or special characters are used in names, as using these can lead to problems. First, we create the port and specify the shared network there: . openstack port create --network &lt;ID of shared Networks&gt; &lt;Name of Ports&gt; .

Create the endpoint groups . When using multiple subnets, make sure your VPN endpoint supports routing multiple subnets through the same connection. While OpenStack does, for implementations that do not support this, multiple endpoint groups need to be created, one for each subnet. Using Horizon (GUI) . | Create the local endpoint group for the left side. | . Within your project, navigate to Network → VPN, select Endpoint Groups and click Add Endpoint Group. Give your endpoint group a name, select the Type “Subnet” and select your subnet under Local System Subnets. Click Add. | Create the peer endpoint group for the left side. | . Still within Network → VPN, Endpoint Groups, click Add Endpoint Group again. Give your endpoint group a name, select the Type “CIDR” and enter the subnet of the right side. Click Add.

Create the site connections . Just like with the endpoint groups, if your VPN endpoint does not support routing multiple subnets through the same connection, you need to create multiple site connections, one for each subnet/endpoint group. Using Horizon (GUI) . Within your project, navigate to Network → VPN, select IPSec Site Connections and click Add IPSec Site Connection. Give your connection a name, select the previously created VPN service, local endpoint group, IKE and IPSec policy, Pre-Shared Key, Peer IP and router identity. For the purposes of this guide, we will assume that 2001:db8::4:703 is the IP address of the right router. Using the CLI . Use the openstack vpn ipsec site connection create command to create the VPN service. $ openstack vpn ipsec site connection create \\ vpnaas-left-connection \\ --vpnservice vpnaas-left-vpn \\ --ikepolicy vpnaas-left-ike-policy \\ --ipsecpolicy vpnaas-left-ipsec-policy \\ --local-endpoint-group vpnaas-left-local \\ --peer-address 2001:db8::4:703 \\ --peer-id 2001:db8::4:703 \\ --peer-endpoint-group vpnaas-left-remote \\ --psk 1gHAsAeR8lFEDDu7 +--------------------------+----------------------------------------------------+ | Field | Value | +--------------------------+----------------------------------------------------+ | Authentication Algorithm | psk | Description | | ID | d81dbe28-ccda-4ee3-ba96-145fadc74e0f | IKE Policy | 561387b8-b5c1-415e-abc9-79ba93dd48ff | IPSec Policy | 553a600e-f39d-47a0-9550-97f2b4033685 | Initiator | bi-directional | Local Endpoint Group ID | 949ccc53-5dc6-457d-95bf-278fdf9a3e5d | Local ID | | MTU | 1500 | Name | vpnaas-left-connection | Peer Address | 2001:db8::4:703 | Peer CIDRs | | Peer Endpoint Group ID | 9146346d-1306-4b03-a3ce-04ee51832ed8 | Peer ID | 2001:db8::4:703 | Pre-shared Key | 1gHAsAeR8lFEDDu7 | Project | 281fa14f782e4d4cbfd4e34a121c2680 | Route Mode | static | State | True | Status | PENDING_CREATE | VPN Service | cc258fd7-0e87-4058-ad7d-355f32c1ab5e | dpd | {'action': 'hold', 'interval': 30, 'timeout': 120} | project_id | 281fa14f782e4d4cbfd4e34a121c2680 | +--------------------------+----------------------------------------------------+ .

The individual data is not assigned to individual blocks on a device, but is stored as binary objects within a storage cluster. The necessary metadata is stored in a separate database. The storage cluster consists of several individual servers (nodes), which in turn have several storage devices installed. With the storage devices, we have a mix of classic HDDs, SSDs, and modern NVMe solutions. The CRUSH algorithm, which is implemented on the server-side of the Object Storage, decides which device an object ultimately lands on. ",

After the successful installation of S3cmd, the previously created credentials must be entered into S3cmd configuration file. The file responsible for this is “.s3cfg”, which is located in the home directory by default. If this file does not yet exist, it must first be created. We then enter the following data in the .s3cfg and save it: . access_key = aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa check_ssl_certificate = True check_ssl_hostname = True host_base = s3.es1.fra.optimist.gec.io host_bucket = s3.es1.fra.optimist.gec.io secret_key = dddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd use_https = True . S3Browser . The S3Browser can be downloaded here and easily installed afterwards. After this has been successfully installed, we then need to enter all necessary credentials.

However, an owner can grant access to other users on by using an Access Control List (ACL). The ACL can be set on each container, and is applicable only to that container and the objects within that container. Some of the main elements which can be used to set an ACL on a container are listed below: . | Element | Description | . | .r:*. | Any user has access to objects. No token is required in the request. | . | .r:&lt;referrer&gt; | The referrer is granted access to objects. The referrer is identified by the Referer request header in the request. No token is required. | . | .r:-&lt;referrer&gt; | This syntax (with “-” prepended to the referrer) is supported. However, it does not deny access if another element (e.g., .r:*) grants access. | . | .rlistings | Any user can perform HEAD or GET operations on the container if the user also has read access on objects (e.g., also has .r:* or .r:&lt;referrer&gt;. No token is required. | . As an example, we will set the policy .r:*. on a container called &lt;example-container&gt;. This policy will allow any external user access to the objects within the container. swift post example-container --read-acl \".r:*\" . Conversely, we can also allow users to list but not access the list of objects within a container by setting the .rlistings policy on our example-container: . swift post example-container --read-acl \".rlistings\" . To remove any read policy and set the container to its default private state, the following command can be used: . swift post -r \"\" example-container . To check which ACL is set on a container, use the following command. swift stat example-container . This gives an overview of the stats for the container and displays the current ACL rule for a container. Prevent Listing on Containers when using the .r:*. policy: . In the current version of OpenStack, to prevent the contents from being listed while using the .r:*. policy on a container, we recommend creating an empty index.html object within the container. This will allow users to download objects without listing the contents of the buckets. This can be accomplished with the following steps: . Firstly, add the blank index.html file to our example-container: . swift post -m 'web-index: index.html’ example-container . Then create the index.html file as an object within the container: . touch index.html &amp;&amp; openstack object create example-container index.html .

    "content": "Bucket policies are used to control access to each bucket in a project. It is recommended to set a policy on all buckets upon creation. The first step is to create a policy as follows. The following template only requires that you change the bucket name for subsequent policies, The below example creates a policy for bucket example-bucket: . cat &gt; examplepolicy { \"Version\": \"2008-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Sid\": \"AddPerm\", \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Principal\": \"*\", \"Action\": \"s3:GetObject\", \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket/*\" } ] } . Breakdown of each element within the above policy example: . | Version: Specifies the language syntax rules to be used to process the policy. It is recommended to always use: “2012-10-17” as this is the current version of the policy language. | Statement: The main element of the policy, the other elements are located within this statement. | SID: The Statement ID, this is an optional identifier which can be used to describe the policy statement. Recommended so that the purpose of each policy is clear. | Effect: Set either to “Allow” or “Deny” | Principal: Specifies the principal that is allowed or denied access to a resource. Here, the wildcard “*” is used to apply the rule to all. | Action: Describes the specific actions that will be allowed or denied. | . (For further information on the available policy options and how to tailor this to your specific needs, please see the official AWS documentation). Next, apply the newly created policy to bucket example-bucket: . s3cmd setpolicy examplepolicy s3://example-bucket . You will also be able to run the following command afterwards to see that the policy is in place: . s3cmd info s3://example-bucket . Once the policy is applied, you can set once again set Public Access: Disabled on the Dashboard. Once the above steps have been taken we will have the following results: . | The container will be private, and files will not be listed or displayed via XML. | The policy now allows access to specific files with a direct link. | .

Customising index.html, page.html, and 404error.html pages .

They essentially differentiate READ and WRITE permissions: . | READ - Allows grantee to list the objects in the bucket | WRITE - Allows grantee to create, overwrite, and delete any object in the bucket | . The limitations of ACLs were addressed by the access policy permissions (ACP). We can attach a no-delete policy to the bucket, e.g. { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Sid\": \"nodelete1\", \"Effect\": \"Deny\", \"Action\": [ \"s3:DeleteBucket\", \"s3:DeleteBucketPolicy\", \"s3:DeleteBucketWebsite\", \"s3:DeleteObject\", \"s3:DeleteObjectVersion\" ], \"Resource\": [ \"arn:aws:s3:::*\" ] } ] } . Unfortunately, the S3 protocol itself wasn’t designed with the concept of WORM (write once read many) backups in mind. Access policy permissions do not differentiate between changing an existing object (which would effectively allow deleting it) and creating a new object.

The storage backend of the local storage instances is protected against the failure of individual storage media in the array, however, the resulting redundancy compared to the Ceph-based instances only exists within the hypervisor node providing the instance. When replacing individual components following a hardware issue, there may be limited availability and performance for a short time until recovery. The hypervisors are subject to our defined patch cycle where we must boot through the hypervisors one by one. As the instances are using local storage, the maintenance work cannot be carried out uninterrupted, unlike flavors based on Ceph storage. Consequently, there is a regular maintenance window for l1 Flavors. Within each Availability Zone, one server after the other is updated and rebooted during the defined maintenance window. Within the maintenance window, running instances are shut down by our system and stopped after 10 minutes. ",

However, you can address this by doing a cluster setup (application based) with l1 flavors, running larger l1 flavors in parallel and rolling your data from the old l1 to the new l1 flavors. Shelving/Snapshotting: Both features are possible, but due to the larger disk size within l1 flavors we do not recommend this, as the associated upload will take much longer.

The first option is to take a snapshot of the running instance by installing and running the qemu-guest-agent. It can be installed and run as follows: . apt install qemu-guest-agent systemctl start qemu-guest-agent systemctl enable qemu-guest-agent . Once the qemu-guest-agent is running, the snapshot can be created. Additionally, when uploading your own images, we recommend that you include --property hw_qemu_guest_agent=True to install this upon creation of the new image. The second option is to stop the running instance, create the snapshot, then start the instance again. This can be done via the Horizon Dashboard or on the CLI as follows: . openstack server stop ExampleInstance openstack server image create --name ExampleInstanceSnapshot ExampleInstance openstack server start ExampleInstance .

OpenStack and many deployment tools support using these images either by name or by their UUID. By using a name, for example Ubuntu 22.04 Jammy Jellyfish - Latest, you can easily stay up to date by redeploying or rebuilding your instances, even if we replace the image in the interim.

Our images are based on a regular installation of Windows Server 2019 standard edition, version 1809 (LTSC). We have added the latest drivers for our virtualization infrastructure, for the network card and storage. Next, we installed the most recent OpenSSH build for windows, and the most recent version of PowerShell. Both are required for the following provisioning steps, and to allow you to initially connect to your instance. We also enabled the RDP service, which is required for remote desktop connections. Don’t forget to add the required security groups for this, and be sure to limit access as much as possible. We have also disabled AutoLogon for security reasons. Our images also come with Spectre and Meltdown mitigations enabled. Additionally we had to disable the random MAC address generator, since our virtual networks enforce fixed MAC addresses. For your convenience and security, we provide these windows images with the latest cumulative updates for Windows and the .NET framework. After booting up an instance, you’ll most likely only have to update the Windows Defender definitions. Finally, we optimized the available DotNetAssemblies, added firewall rules to allow ICMP echo replies and installed cloud-init. The latter is responsible for adding your ssh keys to the new instances. How to use them? . Almost as easy as deploying a linux instance. Add your ssh key to OpenStack (CLI or Dashboard) and deploy the instance. You can then connect to the instance with the following command: . ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa $instanceIP -l Administrator . From here, you can set a password for your Administrator account for use with Remote Desktop: . net user Administrator $password . We strongly discourage using the previous method, adding admin_pass to the instances metadata. This is not encrypted or protected in any way, and is not guaranteed to work due to password security requirements. Be aware: Our Images come without product keys or licenses.
