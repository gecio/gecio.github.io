# Product Overview

The ONCITE Open Edition provides an easy-to-use VM and a container platform based on Open Source. It is scalable from the size of an Edge to the size of a data center and offers full data sovereignty and real-time capabilities.

## Architecture

For providing Virtual Machines on the Edge we use Openstack. The provided Storage is handled by CEPH.
To create and manage the VMs the Customer can use the OperationsCenter, which is connected via LDAP for SingleSignOn.
Administrators can use the Openstack Horizon, which is not connected to LDAP.
