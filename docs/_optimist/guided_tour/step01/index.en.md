# Step 1: The Horizon (Dashboard)

## Start

In this step-by-step tutorial, you will learn how to use OpenStack.

You will start with the Horizon dashboard, then switch to the
console and finish with writing your own Heat
template.

## Login

After you have received your credentials, you can log on to the
dashboard.

**IMPORTANT**: You cannot automatically reset the password. If you
need a new password, write an e-mail to <support@gec.io>

The URL for the dashboard is
<https://dashboard.optimist.innovo.cloud>

your user name and password in the relevant fields.

To log in, click *Connect*.

## Change Password

For security reasons we recommend changing your password after
receiving it from GEC.

To change the password, click your *User name* (1) in right corner of
 Horizon and then *Settings* (2).
